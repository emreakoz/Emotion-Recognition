# Emotion-Recognition
This repository builds a deep CNN to detect the facial expressions such as anger, disgust, hear, happiness, sadness, surprise neutral and comfort. The training is done on the University of Denver's AffectNet database. 

Furthermore, five years of Marathon demographics information such as age, gender, pace etc. is scraped from Chicago and London Marathons from 2014 to 2018. The latent vectors of the pre-trained deep CNN is concatanated with the demographics information to pedict the marathon runners' emotional state.
