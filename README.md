# Emotion-Recognition
This repository builds a deep CNN to detect the facial expressions such as anger, disgust, hear, happiness, sadness, surprise and neutral. The training is done on a portion of the University of Denver's AffectNet database. The trained network is tested on marathon runner photos as a small fun application.
